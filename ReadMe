I wrote the project using Nodejs since that's what I studied in web dev. This is what I was able to do in ~5 hrs, 
but my html is pretty rusty and I couldn't get the syntax for reading/writing JSON to save data between sessions right.
I'm also not very familiar with hosting websites on heroku, and for some reason it breaks the arithmetic even though it works fine locally.
